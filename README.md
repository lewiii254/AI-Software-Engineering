# Week 2 codes for the Diabetes 
# 🩺 Diabetes Risk Prediction Using Machine Learning

## 🌍 SDG Focus: SDG 3 - Good Health and Well-being

This project applies machine learning to predict the risk of diabetes using patient health indicators, in support of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 3 (Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages).

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Millions of people live with undiagnosed diabetes, especially in low-resource areas. Early detection of diabetes can lead to timely interventions and better health outcomes. This project demonstrates how supervised machine learning can aid in predicting diabetes risk based on physiological data.

---

## 🔬 Machine Learning Approach

- **ML Type**: Supervised Learning
- **Model Used**: Random Forest Classifier
- **Dataset**: Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset (via [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database))
- **Features**: Pregnancies, Glucose, Blood Pressure, Skin Thickness, Insulin, BMI, Diabetes Pedigree Function, Age
- **Target**: Binary outcome (1: diabetes, 0: no diabetes)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn & Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
